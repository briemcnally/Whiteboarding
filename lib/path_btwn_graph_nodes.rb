# Assume you have an undirected graph, as well as an already-implemented 
# getNeighbors() function which returns a list of all neighbors of a node.
#
# Write a function that accepts a start node and end node, and outputs a
# boolean value indicating whether there exists a path between the two nodes.
# No constraints in terms of time/space requirements -- the goal is to
# write the simplest / most readable solution possible. Take care to
# avoid infinite loops.
