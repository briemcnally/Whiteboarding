# Write a function that accepts as input a binary tree (e.g., the root node 
# of the tree) and outputs the maximum depth of the tree. The tree is
# not necessarily balanced. No constraints in terms of time/space
# requirements -- the goal is to write the simplest / most readable
# solution possible.
